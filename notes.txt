Assignment 2 Notes Files

Part 2.1

For exponents, in emacs we write (expt x y) ;; x^y
- ie. 2^3^4 would be (expt 2 (expt 3 4))
Seeing if 2^3^4 would fit in a 64 bit signed integer
(if (< (expt 2 (expt 3 4)) (expt 2 63) )
    t
  nil)
nil
- using this expressiong we got nil which means that it will not fit
- we know this will not fit bc 2^3^4 = 2^81
- also we have a 64 bit signed integer so the max is 2^63
- 2^3^4 goes over the max (sanity check without using emacs)

After typing C-h b for teh keybinds
- typing C-h k C-h k leads me to a page with info about what the keys C-h k do in combination 
-Info found on C-h k
-C-h k runs the command describe-key (found in global-map), which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘help.el’.
After typing C-h k M-SPC
- typing C-h k C-h k leads me to a page	with info about	what the keys C-h k do in combination
- Info found on M-SPC (M stands for meta)
- M-SPC runs the command just-one-space (found in global-map), which is
an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.
Note: This happens because when we type C-h k it prompts the command describe-key and then when we enter C-h k or M-SPC, the command takes us to a description of the key combination.

Note to self: C-x o to switch between windows

Going into the source code for M-SPC and has description below
(defun just-one-space (&optional n)
  "Delete all spaces and tabs around point, leaving one space (or N space\
s).                                                                       
If N is negative, delete newlines as well, leaving -N spaces.             
See also `cycle-spacing'."

What does M-: do?
M-: runs the command eval-expression (found in global-map), which is
an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

What does M-x do?
M-x runs the command execute-extended-command (found in global-map),
which is an interactive compiled Lisp function in ‘simple.el’.

With the M-SPC, we can go up to the characters and change it so that we have just one space between two words
With the M-:, we can evaluate a lisp expression with the bar instead of typing the expression in the buffer and using the C-j keys. With the M-: we can type a lisp expression and have it evaluated without writing the values down in the buffer. 
With M-x, we are prompted to put in a command and then that command will be executed. ie: we use M-x and prompt the command just-one-space will do the same thing as the M-SPC

Lab 2.2

M-x load-file filepath
--> file path is ~\A2\which-line.el

Need to make sure it does not count new line
  Use an if statement to do this

Comments are listed in the code.


Homework: Python Scripting

What happens when randline.py is invoked on an empty file(/dev/null) ?
Note:this is python 2
- command: python randline.py /dev/null
IndexError: list index out of range
We get an index error because the file is empty!

What happens when this script is invoked with Python 3 rather than Python 2, and why?
Note: run python3 by using python3 instead of python
- command: python3 randline.py /dev/null
  There is a syntax error!


-e, --echo :: treat each ARG as an input line
-i, --input-range=LO-HI :: treat each number LO through HI as an input line
-n, --head-count=COUNT :: output at most COUNT lines
-r, --repeat :: output lines can be repeated
